## 📖 Abstract  
Urban public transport in India faces challenges like overcrowding, irregular bus schedules, passenger discomfort, and inefficient depot operations. Bengaluru, with 35–40 lakh daily commuters, sees heavy strain on BMTC buses.  

**Sanchara Vyuha** is an AI-powered smart depot system that begins with **real-time CCTV passenger counting at bus stands**, integrated with a backend for occupancy tracking and depot-level decision-making.  

This forms the foundation for future **AI-based demand forecasting, IoT integration, and commuter-facing apps**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Implement **real-time passenger monitoring** using CCTV + AI.  
2. Send live data to the backend for analysis and storage.  
3. Track **bus stand crowd levels** and support depot-level decisions.  
4. Establish the base for **scalable AI + IoT integration** across BMTC depots.  

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement  
BMTC currently faces:  
- **Overcrowding**: No accurate occupancy data → discomfort & delays.  
- **Static Scheduling**: Fixed timetables, no real-time adjustments.  
- **Limited Transparency**: Commuters don’t know crowd levels before arrival.  
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Idle buses in low-demand zones, crowded peak routes.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
Our **Phase-1 system** focuses on:  

1. **Passenger Counting Module**  
   - CCTV + YOLOv8 detects and counts passengers at bus stands.  
   - Data pushed to backend servers in real time.  

2. **Backend & Data Storage**  
   - MongoDB-based storage of passenger counts per bus stand.  
   - Enables analytics for depot managers.  

3. **Dashboard (Future Add-on)**  
   - Web-based monitoring for real-time passenger data.  
   - Insights into depot-level occupancy.  

4. **AI Forecasting (Future Scaling)**  
   - Predictive analytics for demand forecasting.  
   - Smarter bus allocations at depots.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **AI/Computer Vision**: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (planned)  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Dashboard (Future)**: React.js / Web App  

---

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: CCTV-based passenger counting at bus stands, backend data logging.  
- **Phase 2**: Live web dashboard for depot managers.  
- **Phase 3**: AI-based demand forecasting & dynamic depot dispatch.  
- **Phase 4**: Full-scale BMTC integration.  

---

## 🌍 Impact  
- **Passengers**: Reduced overcrowding, better experience.  
- **BMTC**: Efficient bus allocation, data-driven planning.  
- **City**: Lower congestion, reduced CO₂ emissions.
